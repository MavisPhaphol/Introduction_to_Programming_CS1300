    <h2>Developing a School Talent Show</h2>
    <h5>Script Writer and Backstage Crew, February 2020</h5>
    <img src="School Picture.jpg" style="height:200px" alt= "Group of Backstage Crew">
    <p>I joined the team of script writers to write for the talent show, later when it's D-Day of the talent show, I became part of the backstage crew, setting the stage and making the props for different stages. We finished setting the show up by the time lunch ended, so for the rest of the day we have classmates, upperclassmen, and even freshmen coming in to watch the talent show. </p>
    <p>While preparing for the script, we talk about the theme of the show and met with the hosts, performers, and many other people from the backstage and how we would like the show to run. We cut out props, painted them and adjust where the props would be hanging from the ceiling and decorated the stages with other painted props. It was a fun experience of being script writer and part of the backstage crew, meeting a lot of different people that are part of the show. </p>

    <h2>Joined a Sport Team</h2>
    <h5>Played basketball and soccer.</h5>
    <img src="Basketball.jpg" alt="basketball" style="height:200px">
    <p>Started playing sports in 2016 and stopped playing sports altogether in 2018. I was that person who loves to play any sports and be the only girl that likes to be very active whether it's on court or on the field. </p>
    <p>I joined the basketball team and it helped me with communication and team leadership. I realized that the girls on the team would do anything to help the another with the school related work, like getting better grades and understanding how to do this or that for a class. One year we were runner ups in division tournament and was part of the states tournament. Only played soccer for 1 year to experience what it is like as a soccer player. It was very fun and difficult challenge to adapt to a different sport.  </p>
